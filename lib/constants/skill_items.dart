I have made several apps for android using flutter as a Freelancer. The apps that I am mostly proud of are Flexhour and
Smart Wallet. Flexhour is a labour job posting app where users can post jobs and others can accept those jobs. It is a 
full production app with payment gateway integration using Stripe and Firebase as a backend. The Smart Wallet App
is my latest production app for my client. It is a simple and minimalistic app that allows users to manage their documents in 
different categories and can also add their own custom categories. Users can download their documents and also upload them. You can 
find these apps one on Appstore and the other on Playstore. I have made other several apps as well which you can find on my github account.
